Simple application for testing twitter access via openFrameworks, developed for the **El Abismo No Nos Detiene** workshop (http://astrovandalistas.cc/abismo).

It basically builds a database of tweets based on different parameters and characteristics, and also sets up a thread to keep searching for tweets with specific hashtags in real-time.

It currenlty needs the following libs that have to be downloaded separately:
- ofxOAuth (https://github.com/bakercp/ofxOAuth)
- Jansson (https://github.com/akheron/jansson)
